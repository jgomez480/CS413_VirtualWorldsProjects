# Project 3

## Night In The Woods

* Jonathan Gomez (jg3425)
* Jacob Stuck (jps364)
* Kyle Mo (sm3344)

## Instructions
Use the right arrow key to attack and the left key to block. Using an attack or block will take stamina and you need to wait for it to recharge before using a move again. Youre goal is to make it to the end of the forest by clearing all the enemies without taking too much damage. Enemies will make a noise based on what they are before they appear. Each enemy has distinct intial attacks and attack patterns.

## Known Bugs or Issues
After defeating an enemy the attack animation gets cut off and instead moves the player forward immediately. The timing of when the player blocks and the frames when they can still be hit don't sync up perfectly resulting in some strange hits.
