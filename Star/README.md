##	Instructions
A random constellation of stars will be created and the goal is to find and match that same constellation given a 
large field of stars. Use left click to connect stars together and right click on the last star you connected to remove it

##	Known	Bugs	or	Issues
There can be errors if trying to remove connected stars. It is also possible that some stars will be randomly generated in weird ways either they are bunched in one end of the screen or they overlap each other which could makes it difficult to try and match the one you intend to.
